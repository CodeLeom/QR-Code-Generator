# A basic QR Code generator

Once this code is cloned, run `npm i` in your terminal or command prompt to install all the dependencies needed.

Still in your command prompt, run `node index.js`

> you will be prompted in your terminal to input the url you wanted to generate QR code for. Once you enter the url and hit enter, a QR code image will be generated for you immediately.
